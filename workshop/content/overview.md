Welcome to the **Application Toolkit** workshop!

In this workshop, you will use Application Toolkit—VMware Tanzu® Community Edition's newest package—to move a workload from source code to deployment.

**What is Application Toolkit?**

Application Toolkit is a "meta-package" of technologies that enables developers to get a complete, ready-to-use application platform up and running in minutes. You can immediately deploy web applications without requiring knowledge of Kubernetes or other underlying platform technologies.

Application Toolkit simplifies configuration and installation of a developer-ready application platform by neatly bundling a full set of technologies, including:

- Flux CD Source Controller — for obtaining soure code                        
- kpack                     — for building container images                   
- kpack-dependencies        — default builder
- Knative Serving           — for running applications                        
- Cartographer              — for creating software supply chains
- Cartographer Catalog      — example software supply chain for web apps
- Cert Manager              — for managing certificates                       
- Contour                   — to enable ingress to applications

**Where Can I Use Application Toolkit?**

Application Toolkit can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster, whether on your local machine or on cloud infrastructure.

With VMware Tanzu® Community Edition, you can also provision a local Kubernetes cluster and install Application Toolkit in a single command!

**How Does Application Toolkit Work?**
