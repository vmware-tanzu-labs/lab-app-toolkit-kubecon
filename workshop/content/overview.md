Welcome to the **Application Toolkit** workshop!

In this workshop, you will use Application Toolkit—VMware Tanzu® Community Edition's newest package—to move a workload from source code to deployment.

Application Toolkit enables developers to get a complete, ready-to-use application platform up and running in minutes. You can immediately deploy web applications without requiring knowledge of Kubernetes or other underlying platform technologies.

You can also add your own supply chains to support different types of applications and additional use cases such as testing, scanning, etc.

Application Toolkit simplifies configuration and installation of the application platform by neatly bundling a full set of technologies into one "meta-package"
comprising:

- Flux CD Source Controller — for obtaining soure code                        
- kpack                     — for building container images                   
- Knative Serving           — for running applications                        
- Cartographer              — for creating software supply chains             
- Cartographer Catalog      — with example software supply chain for web apps 
- Cert Manager              — for managing certificates                       
- Contour                   — to enable ingress to applications               



Application Toolkit can be used to create a developer-ready Kubernetes cluster on your local machine in one command, or to enhance an existing Kubernetes cluster.

For this workshop, Application Toolkit is installed and ready for you to deploy an application.

Start the workshop to deploy an application and explore behind-the-scenes to understand how it moves from source to deployment!
