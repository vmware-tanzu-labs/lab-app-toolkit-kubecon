Thank you for completing the workshop!

Developers can also install both a local Kubernetes platform and the Application Toolkit with one command. Taking simplicity further still, Docker Desktop users can install and configure a local Tanzu Community Edition cluster directly from their Docker Desktop environment with the new VMware Tanzu Community Edition Extension for Docker Desktop.

Deploy applications immediately ¶
The latest release also helps developers become productive more quickly with ready-to-use application platform tooling that bypasses the container infrastructure learning curve. A provided software supply chain can be used out-of-the-box to move typical, stateless web applications from source to production without developer intervention. This can free developers from time consuming operational work as containers are built, maintained, and deployed automatically. Developers can manage their workloads through the supply chain using simple commands that insulate them from the complexity of Kubernetes and other infrastructure technologies.

Use a preferred local Kubernetes provider ¶
Developers can also use their Kubernetes provider of choice on their development workstation with the expanded ability to run local Kubernetes clusters using Minikube, Kind, or Docker Desktop. Additionally, they can now start and stop local clusters to conserve workstation resources, and can query cluster status to improve visibility into their development environment.
