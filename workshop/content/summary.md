You have completed the Application Toolkit workshop!

In this workshop, you explored how Application Toolkit bundles together the essential components you need to automate a workflow for getting source code to production as asily as possible, most importantly: Cartographer, FluxCD Source Controller, kpack, and Knative Serving.

You also exercised the out-of-the-box workflow that is package with Applicaion Toolkit.

Remember - Application Toolkit is an open source project that can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster!
It is also available as part of the [Tanzu Community Edition](https://tanzucommunityedition.io) package repository.

**Thank you for completing the workshop!**
